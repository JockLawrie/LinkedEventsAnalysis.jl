description: For each person, construct chains of events with no more than 30 days between events in each chain.
max_time_between_events: "30 days"  # Maximum allowable gap within an event chain. Events separated by more than this are in different chains.

linkagedir: "output/testlinkage"    # The output directory resulting from SpineBasedRecordLinkage.run_linkage. Enables events (see below) to be linked to people.
event_tables:
    # tablename: {datafile:   File containing the data of interest. Must have a primary key that matches that used during linkage.
    #             schemafile: File containing the table's schema.
    #             tagcolumn:  The column containing a brief description of each event. This enables us to easily understand the type of event.
